A text-based RPG unfolds entirely within the command-line interface, where players' actions directly interact with the Algorand blockchain.

A command-line interface (CLI) based RPG guides new users through the concepts of the Algorand blockchain.

The game mechanics directly utilize Algorand's features, turning abstract technical concepts into tangible actions within the game's narrative.

This provides a hands-on, interactive learning experience for newcomers to Algorand, making the technology more accessible and engaging.
